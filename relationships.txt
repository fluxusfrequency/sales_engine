One invoice connects the customer to multiple invoice items, one or more transactions, and one merchant

At least one transaction where their credit card is charged. If the charge fails, more transactions may be created for that single invoice.

One or more invoice items: one for each item that they ordered

The transaction references only the invoice
The invoice item references an item and an invoice
The item is connected to many invoice items and one merchant
The merchant is connected to many invoices and many items
Prices, as represented in the CSVs, are in cents. Anytime you return a revenue total (like in Merchant#revenue) you must return a BigDecimal representating dollars and cents (two decimals, rounded to the nearest cent).
